### Dense layer with backpropagation and sigmoid activation in C++, part 4

In this post I'll modify the previous example adding Sigmoid activation layer.

Previous example can be found at ["Dense layer with backpropagation in C++, part 3"] [previous_post]

Forward path for Sigmoid layer is sigmoid function

$$ \sigma {(x)} = \frac {1} {1 + e^{-x}} $$

For backpropagation we'll need to find sigmoid derivative
$$
\frac{\partial{\sigma{(x)}} \partial{x}}
$$


Let's use $$ f(x) = \frac {1 \sigma{(x)}} $$

$$
1. f(x) = \frac{1 \sigma{(x)}}
2. f(x) = 1 + e^{-x}
$$

Taking derviatives
